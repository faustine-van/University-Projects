# Java OOP Projects

This directory contains a collection of Java projects I built while learning **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. These projects were created as part of my coursework and practice in applying core OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Classes and Objects
- Constructors and Methods
- Inheritance and Interfaces
- Encapsulation and Access Modifiers
- Abstract Classes
- Exception Handling
- File I/O
- JDBC with PostgreSQL

| `Classesandobjects`  | include some others files                                         |
| `User.java`          | Demonstrates polymorphism with shape classes.                     |
| `PostgresConnect.java` | Connects to a PostgreSQL database using JDBC. Demonstrates DB access. |

##🚀 How to Run Any Project
```#Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/faustine-van/University-Projects.git
cd University-Projects/java-oop-projects
# Compile:
javac FileName.java
# Run:
java FileName
```
For JDBC-based files, include the driver in the classpath as shown below.

## 🧩 How I Learned JDBC with PostgreSQL

I created the file `PostgresConnect.java` to learn how Java connects with PostgreSQL databases using JDBC. Here's how I set it up:

### 🔽 Download JDBC Driver
```bash
wget https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download/postgresql-42.6.0.jar
# move driver
mv postgresql-42.6.0.jar java-oop-projects/
cd java-oop-projects
#✅ Compile the Java file
javac -cp postgresql-42.6.0.jar PostgresConnect.java
#▶️ Run the Program
javac -cp postgresql-42.6.0.jar PostgresConnect.java
```
